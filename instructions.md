#### Goals
- Implement Tic Tac Toe for one client playing "X" and a computer playing a random "O" in response.

#### Pre Work
- Write a document that describes each step of the process.
- What steps do you know how to do?
- What steps require research?


#### Problem Breakdown
- What are you going to use to display a tic tac toe board?
- How is the user going to fill in the moves?
- When are you going to check for victory conditions?


#### Rules
- X moves first.
- A piece may be placed on any empty space.
- A player wins by being the first to connect a line of friendly pieces from one side or corner of the board to the other.
- The game ends when either one player wins or it is no longer possible for a player to win (in which case the result is a draw).


#### Stories
- Clicking New Game starts the game over.
- When a team wins the game, Alert box announcing which team won, board gets reset.


#### Stretch
- Design a computer player that will respond with the ideal move in each situation.
